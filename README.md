This library implements common computer vision metrics in PyTorch. Algorithms are _tested_ and can serve as an easy starting point to benchmark algorithms.

- Mean Average Precision (mAP), Precision-Recall, IoU, GIoU
- Support for **rotated** bounding boxes
- **Polygon intersection** on the **GPU**
