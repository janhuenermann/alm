# alm
This library implements common computer vision metrics in PyTorch. Algorithms are _tested_ and can serve as an easy starting point to benchmark algorithms.

- **Convex polygon intersection** on the **GPU** using Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm
- **Convex hull** on the **GPU**
- Mean Average Precision (mAP) of polygons, Precision-Recall, IoU, GIoU
- Support for **rotated** bounding boxes
